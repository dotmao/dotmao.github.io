        <h1>My Road To UX Design:</h1>
        <div class="p1">
          <p>
          My love for art and design began as a child in arts & craft classes but unfortunately, by junior high and high school, the traditional Chinese education system didn't expose me to any more classes.
          Culturally, our nation lacks genuine appreciation of art and design, they are often judged as a hobby than a proper career path.
          But I was always amazed by how complex ideas are brought to life with design, whether it was print design, or motion design, or product design or architecture.
          </p>

            At age of 18, I had the privilege to come to the United States for college.
            I didn't know what my future career path would be and couldn't decide on a major based on my interests.
            Therefore, I followed the trend and chose to major in business. After 4 years of business school,
            I became increasingly frustrated due to my consistent doubt of my career choice.

          <p>
            As I began to ponder my future, I felt happy because being in America meant that I could rekindle my passion for the arts.
            No one here was going to judge me for pursuing this path as a career.
            Towards my senior year, it was too late to change my major but I changed my minor from Math to Graphic Design to align with my interest and thought I would go from there.

            After graduation, I worked at a boutique marketing agency. Little did I know, I was introduced to UX design as a marketer. I developed an enormous interest in UX design where designers are the problem solving wizards for others. I knew I had to make a career change.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background as a marketer is not too far from being a UX designer, I solve problems for clients all the time and I understand the value of research, the only difference from UX design research is that we call “users” “customers” instead. With my marketing experience, I have the ability to strike a balance in advocating user needs without compromising business objectives.

          <p class="blod-paragraph">
            With a bit of luck and tons of confusion along the way, I finally can call myself a designer and I am thankful for this entire journey.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I truly believe design is a powerful medium to improve people’s lives. From customer-centered sector to health care and science sector, UX designer can create meaningful and intuitive journeys to improve efficiency and increase accessibility for human beings. I am thrilled to be one of them!
