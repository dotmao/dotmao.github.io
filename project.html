          Cloud storage services become one solution to the problem.
          However, many frustrations such as poor file organization and lack of collaboration control still remain in the market.

        <p>
          In order to validate my initial assumptions, I needed to get the answers from my users then understand what they need and how they use current services.
          I conducted an online user survey and distributed on social media in order to optimize my response rate.
          The survey was designed with the following
          <span>objectives</span>

            <li>If they are not using cloud storage, what would encourage them to use it?</li>
            <li>What are some concerns they have over cloud storage services?</li>

          In order to better visualize the infrastructure of the site, I crafted user flows started from simple sketch to refined digital format. Then I created a list of user stories to prioritize user tasks and build <span>MVP(minimum viable product)</span>.
          I mapped out the easiest and the most common path for users to sign up and log in to their account, how to upload from the dashboard, create content from the dashboard, organize content and managing account settings.

            <p>Design does not happen on the screen first. Almost all projects start with some quick sketches on paper or whiteboards.
            It is basic, fast and easy to complete and it allows ideas flow freely with just a pen in hand.
            There is no distraction from design details such as colors, fonts and spacing in sketching.
            The procedure solely focuses on idea generation.

              Although it is a concept, a brand identity is still necessary.
              I started mapping out <span>name associations</span>, soon enough, I focused on the idea of “space” due to its direct link to cloud service. I chose the brand name “NOVA”, which represents brightness, brilliance and infinity. The brand identity was born accordingly. NOVA, the new star in cloud service industry, conveys advanced technology,
              provides seamless workflow and is committed to being transparent with all users.

              With the brand values and our target market in mind, I decided to choose blue as our main color scheme.
              However, the traditional vibrant blue that is often used for large corporations was not the best fit for the audience.
              I wanted a color that speaks trust and innovation. After a few trials, I found that the combination of Tiffany blue with light green shade was a very interesting color for this brand.
              It was very modern, stylish and a subtle color for screen use. I designed the logo in different versions based on a cloud shape I drew and ran a preference test.
              I then established my <span>style guide</span> for the site according to the result of my logo preference test.

              The preview of text-type files such as word document, excel or PDF is not particularly helpful due to lack of legibility of the content.

        <p>
          As my first complete UX and UI design project, it has been an incredible learning experience.
          I gained hands-on insights on the importance of each design stage and how they tie with each other as a whole to make seamless user experience. I particularly enjoyed how I was able to use the data collected from user survey and interview to make some crucial design decisions. As a former marketer, it was natural to design this project with business goals in mind, which is a great practice when crafting brand identity and analyze target market.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Further improvements:
          With limited time and resources, I did not get the amount of survey response I wanted.
          Therefore, if time permits I would conduct more a thorough user survey to distill user insights by asking more specific questions and distribute the survey in more channels.
          For qualitative research, I would also like to interview more users remotely and in-person to study their behavior while using competitor’s service.
