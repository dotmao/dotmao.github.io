I chose the brand name “NOVA”, which represents brightness, brilliance and infinity. The brand identity was born accordingly. NOVA, the new star in cloud service industry, conveys advanced technology,
                    provides seamless workflow and is committed to being transparent with all users.

                  However, the traditional vibrant blue that is often used for large corporations was not the best fit for the audience.
                  I wanted a color that speaks trust and innovation. After a few trials, I found that the combination of Tiffany blue with light green shade was a very interesting color for this brand.
                  <span>It is very modern, stylish and a subtle color for screen use.</span> I designed the logo in different versions based on a cloud shape I drew and ran a preference test.
                  I then established my <span>style guide</span> for the site according to the result of my logo preference test.

                  With all my visual assets completed, I created a series of high-fidelity mockups for both large screen and mobile screen. In order to validate my design decisions and to ensure usability, user testing is a must. I drafted a clickable prototype on Invision then I conducted both <span>A/B testing (preference test through UsabilityHub)</span> and <span>in-person interviews</span> with users. The feedback I have received was incredibly valuable. I noticed some user errors due to lack of signifiers on my UI elements and unclear language on Web copy. I was able to address all the issues and modify my design accordingly based on user feedback. After rounds of iterations and rapid prototyping, NOVA was good to go.

              As my first complete UX and UI design project, it has been an incredible learning experience.
              I gained hands-on insights on the importance of each design stage and how they tie with each other as a whole to make seamless user experience. I particularly enjoyed how I was able to use the data collected from user survey and interview to make some crucial design decisions. As a former marketer, it was natural to design this project with business goals in mind, which is a great practice when crafting brand identity and analyze target market.

              <span>Further improvements:</span>
              With limited time and resources, I did not get the amount of survey response I wanted.
              Therefore, if time permits I would conduct more a thorough user survey to distill user insights by asking more specific questions and distribute the survey in more channels.
              For qualitative research, I would also like to interview more users remotely and in-person to study their behavior while using competitor’s service.
